# README
Demonstrate some examples of using `grype`.

For reducing number of vulnerabilities refer to:
* Distroless [README.md](../28_distroless/README.md)  
* Nix [README.md](https://github.com/chrisguest75/nix-examples/blob/master/README.md)  

## Prerequisites
```sh
# install grype
brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
```

## Scanning




## Liveserver in vscode
Use the live share extension.  
The example uses a `./out/images.json` file that has to be served up from a webserver.

```sh 
# use a live server to server up pages that have resources
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```
